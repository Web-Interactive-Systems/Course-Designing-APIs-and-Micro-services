# NodeJS and Postgres DB

In this unit, we will learn how to use NodeJS with a PostgreSQL database using the Supabase client library. Supabase provides a fully functionning backend on the top of PostgreSQL databases easily. It also provides a set of tools and libraries to interact with the databases.

## Prerequisites

* [ ] Basic knowledge of NodeJS and npm
* [ ] NodeJS installed on your machine
* [ ] A code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code)


## Exercise 1: Project Setup

* [ ] Create an NPM Project `lab-nodejs-supabase,` `src/index.js` and `start` script


## Exercise 2: Supabase Cloud

Supabase is open source and can be installed in local machine. However, we will use their free cloud solution.

* [ ] Learn more about supabse <https://supabase.com/>
* [ ] Use your github account to create a free account on supabase
* [ ] Create a table on supabase using the dashboard
* [ ] Add some data to the table you have created


## Exercise 3: Supabase client

Now, we will use supabase JS client to communicate with the database from our NodeJS project.
