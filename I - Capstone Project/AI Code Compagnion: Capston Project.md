# AI Code Compagnion: Capston Project

In this project we will prototype a AI compagnion as a code assistant. The goal of this project is to practice all the knowledge we aquired during this course. In addition, we will have a unique opportinuty to learn about and new technologies, such as a text editor, a code editor, code annotations, and more.

## Tasks Analysis

For example, a developer should be able to interact with the AI assistant to perform the following:

*   Help me complete this code I just started writing
*   Help me fix this bug. I expect to see: \`\`\` \`\`\` but instead I see: \`\`\` \`\`\`
*   Show me some alternative ways to solve this particular problem
*   Annotate this code with comments to explain what each part does
*   Explain what this code does line-by-line
*   Explain what this code does at a higher conceptual level
*   My code seems to be stuck in an infinite loop; help me fix it
*   Critique this code like an expert code reviewer would
*   Suggest some specific ways to improve this code
*   Help me write some test cases for this code

## Client - Server

The project should work using a client-server architecture. The client is the user interface. The server handles the http requests/reponses.

## Realtime Communicaiton

The client and the server should be able to communicate using realtime technology, such as SocketIO.
